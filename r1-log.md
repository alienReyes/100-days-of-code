## Log

### R1D1

Starting with my own blog, haven't decided if it should be Nuxt or Gridsome
I feel like Gridsome is a better option but Nuxt has the page transitions and localization options I need

### R1D2

- Seting up git bash on Hyper and VScode
  -updated Prettier settings and all that shit, that took days fucking VSCODE and windows
